# Project: Travel App

This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

Final project of the front end web developer course, by Udacity.

Developed by Michel Roman Vieira.
